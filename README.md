# 🩺 Healthcare Premium Prediction Using Regression

### 📊 A Machine Learning project by [Mohd Bilal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bilal-mohd)

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Predicting **health insurance premiums** is a critical challenge for insurers — one that involves understanding human, lifestyle, and health factors that influence pricing.  

In this project, I built a **data-driven regression model** to estimate premium amounts using demographic and health data. The pipeline covers every stage of the **machine learning lifecycle**:  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Model building & optimization  
- Model evaluation & interpretation  
- (Optional) Deployment preparation  

The goal: **help insurers predict costs more accurately while maintaining fairness and transparency**, and demonstrate full-stack ML workflow proficiency.

## 🧠 Technical Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration  
- Visualized distributions & correlations across features (age, BMI, smoker status, region, etc.).  
- Identified outliers and missing values.  
- Derived initial hypotheses about feature influence.

### 2️⃣ Data Preparation  
- Encoded categorical data using One-Hot Encoding.  
- Scaled numerical variables.  
- Split data into **train/test sets** ensuring balanced representation.

### 3️⃣ Model Building  
Implemented and compared multiple regression algorithms:
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge & Lasso Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation  
Compared models using:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
- **R² Score**

Final Model: **Random Forest Regressor** (highest accuracy and generalization).  

### 5️⃣ Insights & Interpretability  
- **Top drivers** of premium: age, BMI, smoker status.  
- Developed feature-importance visualization to improve interpretability.  
- Demonstrated how model predictions can guide better pricing strategies.
